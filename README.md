Hi there. My name's Alex Nguyen. Or you can call me shortnamesalex, a name that I've used across a bajillion different social media accounts.

Anyways, the website you are seeing here is home to my 2nd ever resource pack, Crispin. It was born on 4/18/2020, a day after my friends birthday, Rutherin. If you don't know who she is, I'll give you a summary.

She is a gifted shader developer, a texture artist, a modeler, a cutie, an expertise in her field that constantly proves me wrong cause I don't even have the bare minimum knowledge of OpenGL, or anything really, and an awesome, loveable person.

**Features:**

Hand-drawn textures made by my hands.
labPBR support (specular maps, normal maps and emissive maps).
Custom music disc music. (all of them are not copyrighted btw)

**Shader recommended:**

Rutherin's Raspberry Shaders

(go and support rutherin on patreon, she deserves all the support she has.)

**Other shaders recommended:**

(raspberry for now only runs on nvidia cards so here are some alternatives if raspberry doesnt work.)

Capt Tatsu's BSL Shaders

Sildur's Vibrant Shaders

RRe36's Nostalgia Shader

RRe36's VPlus Shader

**Thanks:**

Paint.net was used to make this pack.

Normal maps were generated through Bounding Box Software's Materalize tool.

Custom music discs:
Downtown Binary - Midnight Tokyo used on music disc Mall.
C418 - Beton used on music disc Blocks.

Big thanks and hugs to: qweebo, rutherin, Snurf, xirreal, dakine, Prismatic Spirit and Chloe in Barazoku for giving me the energy and confidence to keep working on this pack.

This pack wouldn't have been where it is now without all of you~
