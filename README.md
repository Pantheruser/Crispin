Hi there. My name's Alex Nguyen. Or you can call me shortnamesalex, a name that I've used across a bajillion different social media accounts.

Anyways, the website you are seeing here is home to my 2nd ever resource pack, Crispin. It was born on 4/18/2020, a day after my friends birthday, Rutherin. If you don't know who Rutherin is, I'll give you a summary.

She is a gifted shader developer, a texture artist, a modeler, a cutie, an expertise in her field that constantly proves me wrong cause I don't even have the bare minimum knowledge of OpenGL, or anything really, and an awesome, loveable person.

It is supposed to look good with one Ruth's shader packs, a very good one at that, Raspberry. It has a very cute and vibrant look to it and also has shader support too. This means normal, and specular map support, also emissive too but that one doesn't require shaders to work.
