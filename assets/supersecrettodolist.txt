super secret to do list that will be deleted one day.

- recolor one of the bunnies to look like totte. 
- possibly more easter eggs (chloe, prismatic spirit, and barazoku is left.)
- animate emissive for enderdragon egg.
- retexture more blocks to look like rikai (its called inspiration not stealing)
- add more smexy animated emissives to "rikai" styled blocks.
- even moar ctm's (idk how many ctm's this pack will have when its finished kek)
